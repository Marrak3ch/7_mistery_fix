# Quadratic equations solver
The program helps to solve quadratic equasions

# How to use
```python
 if discriminant < 0:  
          return None, None  
    else:  
        root1 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)  
        root2 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)  
        return root1, root2 if discriminant > 0 \  
    else None  
```

# How to launch

Scrit requires installed Python interpretator, version 3.5

Linux launch:

```bash
python tests.py # you man need to call python3 instead python, depends on one's operating system settings
```

The launch on Windows is done in similar way.

# Project aims
